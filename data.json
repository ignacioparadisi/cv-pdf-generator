One of my tasks was to devise an emoji keyboard with a select set of emojis, facilitating users in composing music. The app utilized a machine learning model to harmonize the selected emojis and imagery into music. Additionally, I introduced a 'like' feature to enhance user interaction. I also made the migration of the app from Swift 3 to Swift 4, ensuring the app stayed updated with the latest coding standards, thereby enhancing its performance and maintainability."
